### Zomato Price Prediction

Developed a machine learning model to predict restaurant prices on the Zomato platform. This project involved data collection, cleaning, and preprocessing, followed by exploratory data analysis to identify key features influencing price. Using Python libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and Matplotlib, I built and trained models including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. The final model achieved a high accuracy rate, enabling more accurate price predictions, which can assist users in making informed dining choices and help restaurants in pricing strategy optimization.
